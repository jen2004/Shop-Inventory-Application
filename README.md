I developed a web-based inventory application for the fictional company Green Country Dog Houses using Spring Boot and IntelliJ IDEA.  I started with a base code template provided by the instructor and customized the template for my company.  I added these key modifications:

•	<strong>User Interface Customization</strong>- HTML interface enhancements with shop-specific elements (products and parts).<br>
•	An <strong>"About" page</strong> with navigation to and from the main screen.<br>
•	<strong>Added sample inventory</strong> (5 products and 12 parts) with logic to prevent overwriting existing data.<br>
•	A <strong>"Buy Now" button</strong> to decrement product inventory, with success and failure feedback messages.<br>
•	<strong>Inventory Limits</strong> - Extended the “Part” entity to include maximum and minimum inventory fields.  Modified forms and tables to manage and display these limits.  Enforced validation for inventory constraints during part addition and updates.<br>
•	<strong>Validation Enhancements</strong> - Added error messages to handle low or high inventory conditions for parts and associated products.<br>
•	<strong>Unit Testing</strong> - Wrote and completed unit tests for maximum and minimum inventory constraints.<br>

I completed this project during my 4th semester at WGU as a part of the class, Java Frameworks D287. 

For the complete project requirements, please refer to the "Task Overview" pdf file.  Additional project details can be found in these files: Shop Inventory Management User Guide.pdf, UML diagram.png, and Products and Parts.jpg.  The file “Products and Parts” was created by me for my project idea while the other files were provided by the course instructor.

Refer to "Project Report for Shop Inventory" for the report that I submitted with my course project, which describes the code changes for parts C-J from the project requirements.

To use this application, open the code files in IntelliJ IDEA 2024.2.0.1.  Run the applciation in IntelliJ, then you can access the application at http://localhost:8080/.
